Event by NK Production | M6 Music | Redroom_blr

About the Artist : The YellowHeads was formed by two musicians who quickly discovered a key common denominator that unites them: a strong passion for music.

What came next was a merging of their styles, different but parallel, as their musical roots come from the same place, and they formed the crew The YellowHeads.

This union’s strength is in their sound, going from highly atmospheric electronic music to a techno sound with retro touches.

Their releases have seen the light on labels such as: Kraftek, Suara, Toolroom, Tronic, Break New Soil, Analytictrail, Phobiq, Trapez, 100% Pure, Bitten, etc...,

With collaborations and remixes by: Cari Lekebusch, Alex Bau, Joey Beltram, Paride Saraceni, Cristian Varela, Samuel L Session, Misstress Barbara, Sasha Carassi, Wehbba, Mark Broom and many more known artists.

The YellowHeads has been a headliner at some of the best clubs and festivals, performing with: Pendulum, Dirtyphonics, Umek, Joseph Capriati, Paco Osuna, Uto Karem, Alan Fitzpatrick, Paul Ritch, Pan-Pot, M.A.N.D.Y., Kaiserdisco, Popof and many more!

In 2014, they were #34 in the World DJs Techno List and their incredible hit “Submerged” was #2 for several months and number #71 in the Best Techno Tracks list, while also being played many times by Carl Cox at his gigs.

Their music is amazing, their live performances are exciting, but do not forget their look is truly the icing on this great musical project called: The YellowHeads!Venue

GODLESS will be hitting Bangalore as a part of their India tour in support of German death metal band DIVIDE. Playing alongside will be thrash metal maniacs Amorphia, and goregrinders Anorectal Ulceration.

The line-up:

DIVIDE
Death metal from Kiel, Germany

Divide plays death metal since 2009. Having released three EPs and one Album, in 2019 the duo will release their second album, 13 songs of pure and raw metal - an impetuous mix of thrash, death, and black metal, that unleashes its energy in rough and memorable live performances. Looking back on ten years of the band, the band has a history of tours in Europe, Russia, and South America multiple times. They're looking at bringing their brand of death metal to the subcontinent for the first time.

GODLESS
Death metal from Hyderabad

From their inauspicious origins, Hyderabad's Godless slowly rose to the very top of the country’s death metal strata. Interestingly, throughout this gradual but inexorable climb, the members of the band didn't distinguish themselves for bringing innovations to the genre so much as for their unapologetic commitment to pure, unadulterated, lightning-fast, ear-shredding, thrash-laced death metal.

AMORPHIA
Thrash metal from Kerala

Amorphia was formed in late 2012 in Kerala, India, and over 9 years, the band released two full-lengths & three singles. The band is currently working on their 3rd studio full-length album to mark their 10-year anniversary. Amorphia released their first single “Master of Death” in 2014, quickly spreading through the Indian metal underground to other parts of the world. In 2018, April the band released the debut album “Arms to Death” which received rave reviews worldwide. In 2020, the band released their 2nd album “Merciless Strike,” which solidified their status as one of India’s leading thrash metal acts. Over 2019 and 2020, the band did two Japan tours including two appearances at the iconic festival True Thrash Fest. The band is currently signed to China-based record label Awakening records. Highly influenced by Sodom, early Kreator, Accuser, Demolition Hammer, and Slayer, Amorphia still manages to create an identity of their own while staying true to their roots. The band’s 3rd studio album is due for release in the first quarter of 2022.

There are specific skills that are involved in bringing magic to the floor and that involves detailed classes where you spend time harnessing those skills and not simply learn moves and combinations.

As harsh as we may have spoken, our current Clean Salsa Only Men’s batch will bring about that much depth and clarity in your dancing!

If you’re here to learn the art form of Salsa in it’s true sense, then do sign up for this course.

Here’s what you can look forward to:
1. Leading v/s enforcing.
2. Salsa Posture.
3. Salsa frame.
4. Holding up the girl.
5. Clean turns.
6. Clean leads.
7. Clarity in thought.
8. Taking charge of the dance.
9. Idea of beat with Music.
10. Etiquette on the socials floor.

Classes in this batch will focus on skills and less on moves. 

Classes will be held every Sunday for 1.5 hours (4:30pm -6pm) for a period of 4 months.

Classes missed by the Student can be made up for at another time mutually discussed with the instructors.

Do not sign up expecting fun. 
Expect hard core Salsa.

Even though the word follow might seem a little weak to some ladies, it isn’t.
Following is anything but weak. If you were taught and you realised the true sense of what following is, such feelings wouldn’t even arise.
Do you think it’s easy to be in complete control of yourself, your body, your mind, your emotions, your balance, your spatial awareness, your footwork with its million steps and variations and still be receptive to every single lead that is being directed towards you??
And it doesn’t end there, you receive and channelise the lead into something so beautiful and elegant and make the whole process look magical.
Not only do you get to feel powerful and good; you also get to make the other person and the dance and your surroundings look as classy and beautiful as you are!

If you want to understand the depth of being a Salsa follower, do not even hesitate to enrol into this challenging yet highly enriching course designed to suit Salsa dancers of all levels.

Classes will be held every Sunday for 1.5 hours for a period of 4 months.

Frequently Asked Questions

What is the Alexander Technique?
Developed by F. Matthias Alexander in 1894 this Technique is essentially a re-educative self-help system that promotes better health by improving posture, coordination and breathing. It is used by people from all backgrounds and all ages both in the arts, in offices and businesses, at home and in all sporting activities. Doctors frequently recommend a course of lessons to their patients to assist with poor posture, whiplash injury, all kinds of back problems (including slipped discs) or with respiratory troubles. Many well known celebrities, sportspeople and performers take lessons to manage stress and improve their performance in whatever they do.
 Why might I need a course of lessons?
You may have poor posture or troublesome tension. You may have quite severe physical pains or difficulties, coordination problems, or voice or breathing difficulties. Or you might wish to prevent yourself getting into difficulties from poor postural habits. You might wish to improve your performance at playing a musical instrument or in a sport activity. You may wish to present yourself better in a business setting or give more effective presentations. You may wish to look your best. You may wish to reduce stress effectively.
 How is the Alexander Technique different from other methods?
The F.M. Alexander Technique is quite unlike anything else around in the psycho-somatic disciplines. Alexander discovered a centrally integrating principle that determines the way all vertebrates use themselves. By consciously employing Alexander’s principle together with the active positive prevention measures and the psycho-somatic conscious directions you develop your underlying postural support musculature and give yourself the freedom to act from choice rather than out of automatic habits. This process is one you can bring to bear on any activity in life which makes the Technique uniquely continuous rather than a therapist dependent or an intermittent process. The Alexander principle, the conscious psycho-physical directions and the continuousness of the process are unique to the Alexander Technique. The effectiveness of the Alexander Technique has been operationally verified for over 100 years.
 What happens in an Alexander lesson?
The teacher helps you recognise and identify your habit patterns which often are not so obvious. By teaching you how to employ the Technique in daily life activities like sitting, standing, walking, breathing, bending and so on, you are easily able to apply a better way of functioning in whatever you do. So the Technique is more than a therapy because you learn how to master your own way of using yourself. Specific activities like playing a musical instrument or singing are given particular ways of working that are suitable to overcome individual difficulties and improve performance.

How does the F.M. Alexander Technique work?
By using the Technique you get taller and more self-aware so you can perform every routine daily action with better coordination and skill. It is applicable to any action and can be employed 24 hours a day 365 days a year. The Technique works by getting you more aware of the ways you usually hinder yourself in your everyday actions. Normally these habitual “misuses” (as they are known in AT) are so automatic that they are not observed or felt as anything wrong. By noticing these habits and learning how to stop them you transform your everyday actions.

Are there any exercises I can perform to change these habits?
The Technique begins to help you alter and improve your coordination, breathing and daily actions straight away. In this way your habitual ways of doing things are shown up and you soon discover alternative ways of carrying out any action with less effort and more awareness. You can begin to change these habits at once by applying the basics of the Technique. Teachers often give pupils ways of training so that habit patterns change in a general way by employing what Alexander called “positions of mechanical advantage”. These can be quickly learnt and practised.

Is there any method I can use at any time of the day that can help me improve the way I am doing what I am doing?

In the workshop you will be given practical ways of altering and improving your breathing function safely and certainly. It was breathing issues that started Alexander on his road to discovering the essence of his Technique so improvement in breathing is fundamental to the processes of the Technique.

Workshop Structure
In this workshop, we will explore breathing in terms of Alexander’s outlook. In this 3-hour workshop you will learn:

How to recognise limiting breathing habits in yourself and then,
having learnt the basics of Alexander’s approach begin to employ his time-tested methods to improve your own breathing capacity, fluidity and control

Testimonials
Below are some testimonials from people who use their lungs to great and powerful effect! Robin will be condensing his teachings into simple modalities you can experience and take home in 3 hours to give you a start to a new, natural and fuller breath.

""I had a series of extremely helpful Alexander Technique lessons from Robin earlier this year. Robin is such a patient, knowledgeable and generous teacher. I left feeling wider and taller and armed with lots of tips and exercises to try at home as well as lots of new knowledge about the body and in fact I kept a notebook and wrote up each lesson afterwards as there was so much to take in! The lessons gave me a means to assess myself physically in greater depth than before and helped me to start to have a positive influence on how my body moves and feels. Thank you Robin!"" - Anna Stéphany (Internationally well-known professional Opera singer)
“Robin Simmons has extensive knowledge and experience in coaching which has helped me tremendously. As a professional musician I am now able to rehearse and perform for long hours without pain. The improvements have helped to open up my breathing and improve my tone quality. Besides the huge benefit from private lessons, Robin has provided me with several techniques which I can practice on my own and are very useful for me to maintain a healthy condition. I highly recommend Robin as a coach.” Robert Pickup (Principal Clarinettist, Philharmonia Zürich)

155,The Evolution Procedure of Prof. Dart,bengaluru,"Shoonya Mari, Bengaluru",2700 onwards,EVENTS & WORKSHOPS,https://insider.in/the-evolution-procedure-of-prof-dart-oct9-2022/event,"Any person interested to improve their body awareness, coordination, their poise and freedom of movement might be interested to explore the Dart Procedures. This may include movement professionals, actors, dancers, musicians, gymnasts, athletes, physiotherapists and other health professionals, but you do not need to have any professional interest in the movement to benefit from these procedures. 

This is a 2-day workshop with

An introduction to The Evolution of Movement  by Robin Simmons, a guide to the Dart Procedures based on the Alexander Technique on day 1 and
A detailed exploration of the Dart Procedures on day 2

Features of the Dart Procedures 

The procedures are both practical and psycho-physical, and they are also concerned with an evolutionary ancestral perspective. 

An ancestral evolutionary perspective is concerned with the evolution of movement from invertebrates to vertebrates to mammals and eventually to human movement.
Practical considerations involve the considerations of an evolutionary series of postural attitudes and carefully executed movements based upon the principle of “temporary fixation” (splinting) of body weight-bearing points. The series ranges from attitudes of complete safety (there is nowhere to fall to), to utter precariousness (there is everywhere to fall to).
Principles: As well as the basic principle of temporary fixation Dart also incorporates a principle of temporary eliding.

In this way, the procedures explore not only the limits of the range of movement and balance from each of the postural attitudes but also explore the full freedom of visual range and of respiration.

A Brief Background: the re-discovery of the Procedures

The 3 articles (the Dart papers), and the procedures contained within them, lay undetected until Alexander Technique teacher Alex Murray re-discovered them in 1967. Alex Murray complied a document to outline and formally organise (with illustrations by Pam Hartman), the sequence of procedures Dart had described. Murray later went on to publish a more expanded version contained in a book Skill and Poise (1996) with illustrations by Delia Hardy.

Robin has been helping people manage their pain issues for over 50 years.

About the Alexander Technique
Developed by F. Matthias Alexander in 1894 this Technique is essentially a re-educative self-help system that promotes better health by improving posture, coordination and breathing. It is used by people from all backgrounds and all ages both in the arts, in offices and businesses, at home and in all sporting activities. Doctors frequently recommend a course of lessons to their patients to assist with poor posture, whiplash injury, all kinds of back problems (including slipped discs) or respiratory troubles. Many well-known celebrities, sportspeople and performers take lessons to manage stress and improve their performance in whatever they do.

About Dartwork
The Dart Procedures are an evolving sequence of carefully executed “postures” and movements that Professor Dart developed after having had lessons in the Alexander Technique in 1943. He described them in a series of articles (the Dart papers) addressed to his medical colleagues written in the late 1940’s.

She faithfully replies to you, every time an email bounces. From the message fragments she often finds, she knows there’s a girl in the apartment who’s possibly losing her mind. Sandhya is trekking up in the mountains but can’t quite seem to find her freedom. And then there’s Mrs Raghuraman, who loses her head at a party. 
Four characters intertwined by fate, their stories woven into a tapestry that can only reveal the unspoken, the partial, the incomplete…

Winner of the Infallibles Awards 2021 for the Best Show at the Edinburgh Fringe.

Hidden in Plain Sight v2.0 is the culmination of a nine-year journey. This is a story of four women in the city who are unmoored from society – who have “dropped off the grid” so to speak. In the search for meaning-making in this digital hybrid format, the aesthetics emerged from an exploration of being isolated, mental health, voyeurism and feelings of claustrophobia via a variety of lenses. The choice of dual/multiple frames of the same moment became an invitation to “drifting” or a “wandering” to allow the eye to be drawn to what feels right to the viewer in the moment.

Hidden in Plain Sight nudges the limits of performance making, new writing and the actor’s craft, returning to first principles of why we do what we do, to meet the post-pandemic challenge. This creative process is an inquiry into the actor’s craft – body, voice, presence and imagination – for creating text, performance and design – by placing the experience of the performer at the centre. The actor’s craft and bodily experience is normally in the service of the director’s vision or the exploration of a written text. This collaboration embodies a shared sense of authorship with a need to flatten the conventional hierarchies inherent in theatre-making.

The text has a prism-like structure – where voice and sound move from ornamental concerns about delivery to a central role in the production of dramatic meaning. The sound of the words, the turn of phrase, proper nouns, and even the mantra-like potential nascent in the utterance of a syllable, are released moment to moment to create a free-wheeling exploration of the four women characters at pivotal moments in their lives. Characters exhibit fractal self-similarity – as each woman who has dropped off the grid into liminality, rejected a conventional social position for an encounter with primal energy.
Embedded in the piece is the enigma of the Chhinnamasta – the decapitated Mother goddess from esoteric Hindu-Buddhist traditions informs this conception of primal energy and in an act of self-sacrifice, discovers regeneration and life. Some interpretations embody her as the essence of violent transformation. Other interpretations elaborate instantaneous activation of spiritual energy centres within the body. Words, through written symbols, transmute in uttered sound – in effect, mantra! In the text, this restless search for “truthful sound” has prompted variations on the Zen Koans of Takuan Sōhō, an exploration of the dissolution of the body’s energy centres as given in the Tibetan Book of the Dead and even the incantatory language codes of cyberspace.
The screening of the digital performance will be followed by a discussion and Q&A session on Sunday the 25th of December.

169,A T'ai Chi Masterclass,bengaluru,"Shoonya Mari, Bengaluru",2700 onwards,EVENTS & WORKSHOPS,https://insider.in/a-tai-chi-masterclass-oct22-2022/event,"These ancient movements are performed with utter slowness and attention. Practised in China for hundreds of years they are very relevant for today’s turbulent world. The movements are attractive to watch yet they are not really intended for demonstration. Indeed, they form a meditative movement exercise for the essential benefit of the practiser. Improved health, the fluidity of action, calmness and tranquillity, balance and strength come from practising T’ai Chi. Once learned it can be done anywhere where there are a few yards of space, just for two ten-minute periods each day. Anyone can learn to tune in to the quietness and inner calm the practice of T’ai Chi brings. By being performed very slowly and also because continuous mindfulness and awareness of the whole body in action is essential. T’ai Chi is the continuous interplay of “yin” and “yang” forces.

T’ai Chi lessons always start with a period of stillness and with preliminary practices that are designed to bring about a state of active watchfulness. Giving attention to preventing our misdirected psycho-physical habitual actions is inherently promoted in T’ai Chi as the movements are performed with immense care, so there is plenty of time to observe one’s use, or misuse, and prevent unwanted actions. Actually, unconsidered actions are virtually impossible in practising T’ai Chi, for as soon as you lose conscious connection to the actions you are performing, you find you make a mistake which brings you up short. The arms must always ‘follow’ the torso body actions. The continuous maintenance of a central awareness of the whole body moving in a coordinated unity in an upright, yet ‘relaxed’ manner is of primary importance in T’ai Chi. Suspension from under the head with a spine that is tending to lengthen is the way to think about uprightness.

Please note: Individual / 1-on-1 classes are also available subject to availability. Please write into info@shoonyaspace.com for more details.


Benefits of T'ai Chi
The harmonising effect of the T’ai Chi actions assists in creating a unique alert-yet-meditative quality. So when the left-hand rises the right-hand falls, when the right-hand goes forward the left comes near. Yet, as one of my T’ai Chi teachers, Dr. Chi Chiang Tao said: ‘In T’ai Chi no arm move’. So arm actions are never allowed to dominate but must always follow the whole torso in relation either to weight shift or to body rotation, or both at once.

The Teacher
Robin John Simmons has been working with T’ai Chi since 1969, and has had several teachers including John Yalenezian, Seeow Poon Shing, and especially Dr. Chi Chiang Tao among others. He has taught people of all ages and backgrounds, including well-known TV and film stars, he has run large group classes and also individual sessionsVenue

Kitanu is a five piece band featuring the mysticism of the Indian folk instrument ""Sarod"" blended into elements of Funk,Jazz, Rock N Roll, Disco etc

Kitanu was formed in 2017 by Vocalist Siddhant Sarkar who's fascination for Indian folk instruments gave the idea to mix 'native folk sounds' with conventional 'Western' instruments.
Inspired by Beethoven’s ‘Ode to Joy’ played on sarod, he approached Rohan Prasanna, a classically trained artist, to jam with him and his friends. Thus was born Kitanu, and was later joined by Guitarist Omkar Raghupatruni who brought in his own palette and added dimensions to the sound.

Post the pandemic, with the release of their debut EP in 2021, Pranav Wahi joined as the bassist and finally by Rijul Victor, a close friend of Siddhant, finally leading to all the pieces coming together."

He’s also in a long term relationship with one of those people, and they’ve moved together to Goa, the unofficial capital of partying, drinking, dancing and exploring nature.

228,SAVITRI,delhi,"Akshara Theatre, Delhi",200,THEATRE,https://insider.in/savitri-oct2-2022/event,"'' Savitri ''a realistic play by eminent Marathi playwright Jawyant Dalvi .The play portrays the complex relationships between the characters using the fabric of the constant changing image of women in the early breeze of feminism and women empowerment. The play brief s the idea of marriage and live-in­ relationships of different couples by presenting a paradox about the ''expected and the reality '' between the relationship of husband and wife.


'Savitri' the central character of the story, who right from her childhood is subjected to embarrassment, hat red and is always kept under the radar of doubt by her very own family. Even after years later, her married life gets in jeopardy as her past kept coming back to her which although exactly had nothing to do with 'her'. Her husband despite of being a learned man and a professor by profession follows an ort hodox approach when it comes to his wife's growth h and identity of her own.


What is the final stage of love? ''Marriage''...Are arranged marriages meant to last long? If so what’s in the case of savitri ? How should she deal with a past, which is not even the result of her own deeds? What should she do, leave that past behind? Or should she take it as it comes like her dest ined fate?
The writer raises certain question through this story by providing a lens to understand the prism of the society 'we live in' by touching the arenas of relationships, faith, sanctity of marriage between a husband and a wife, friendship, strength, patriarchy, woman's subjected sexuality along with the whole idea of right and wrong."

The Kushak-e- Firoz (the Palace of Firoz) was strategically built at the banks of River Yamuna. The fort faced riverfront and lush green plains, its staircase leading you to the banks. It has a functioning mosque, a circular baoli (stepwell) known to have water snakes and a hypnotic effect on its visitors (it has recently been barricaded). The fort also has the magnificent Ashokan Pillar in Pali text erected at a height. It is confounding to any visitor how almost 27 tonne of heavy weighing monolith pillar was taken from Haryana and planted inside the fort at such a great height!

Every Thursday evening Djinn (supernatural creatures in Islamic mythology) worship is performed in the complex, with visitors leaving their wish list, and a thread tied to the lattice for the Djinns to fulfill their wishes! The fort in recent years has gained the reputation of being haunted, because of the strong belief of Djinns inhabiting the fort."

It is also called as the ‘Dormitory of the Mughals’, as many Mughal descendants chose to buried here in the crypt.

323,Aggressive Tendencies V21.0,hyderabad,"EXT by The Moonshine Project, Hyderabad",399 onwards,MUSIC,https://insider.in/aggressive-tendencies-v210-oct16-2022/event,"GODLESS
Death Metal
From their inauspicious origins within a very exotic metal music scene, India’s Godless slowly rose to the very top of the country’s death metal class. Interestingly, throughout this gradual but inexorable climb, the members of the band didn't distinguish themselves for bringing innovations to the genre so much as for their unapologetic commitment to pure, unadulterated, lightning-fast, ear-shredding, thrash-laced death metal.

DIVIDE 
Old School Death Metal
Divide plays death metal since 2009.
Having released three EPs and one Album, in 2019 the duo will release their second album, 13 songs of pure and raw metal - an impetuous mix of thrash, death and blackmetal, that unleashes its energy in rough and memorable live performances. Over the course of 10 years, the band has toured multiple places including the whole of Europe, Russia and South America. This is the first time that they'll be bringing their brand of metal to the subcontinent. 

MANIACAL SLAUGHTER
Slam/Grind/Death Metal
Pissed off and aggravated by acts of violence, torture, and mental trauma, MSL formed as a band in October '19. Total rage against the pathetic system full of disregard and hopeless belief is what pushes them towards making music.

MORAL PUTREFACTION
Death Metal
Moral Putrefaction is an Old School Death Metal band from Chennai formed in 2015. The band’s sound is influenced by bands like Bloodbath, Immolation, Morbid Angel, Cannibal Corpse and Carcass. 

The band supported Australian Technical Death Metal band Psycroptic in Chennai in August 2017, and shared the stage with Draconis Infernum from Singapore and Cult of Fire from Czech Republic during Trendslaughter Fest 2018. In 2020, Moral Putrefaction opened for American Death Metal Legends Immolation at Bangalore Open Air Metal Nights. Moral Putrefaction released their first demo, Scum of the Earth, in April 2019 and are currently working on their self-titled album.

In 2022, the band won the Wacken Metal Battle India and played at Wacken, Germany in August."

His idea of fun is staying indoors, watching test match cricket, consuming carbohydrates and taking naps while every other person his age wants to go out and party, drink and dance, and explore nature. In this show, he makes fun of those people for no fault of theirs whatsoever. He’s also in a long term relationship with one of those people, and they’ve moved together to Goa, the unofficial capital of partying, drinking, dancing and exploring nature. So as you can imagine, he’s deeply annoyed and is coming to your city to tell you all about it.Venue

Written by Ahan Ghosh, Sayem and Sarani Deb ( A$$) and Directed by Abhilasha Ghosh, 'Mahalaya Magic' is the story of 5 friends who gather to enjoy the onset of Pujo together but due to turn of events, one of them is left feeling otherwise.

The music, dance and colourful wordplay is an audience favourite. which has lead to us taking the decision of bringing it back on stage for eager audiences after a year from the first show. You can't go wrong with anything remotely smothered with the essence of Durga Pujo in Kolkata can you? 

Come watch us unfold magic on stage.
