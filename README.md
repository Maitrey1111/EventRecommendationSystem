# Recvent-EventRecommendationSystem
Due to the constantly rising number of physical events that occur in an individualâ€™s surroundings today, there is a need for a system that recommends relevant events to the individual based on his location, interests and history, making the individual's choices easier. Hence the paper aims to provide a solution to this problem of the Event-selection dilemma by creating a website capable of suggesting events on the same aspects. The project makes use of a Hybrid Recommendation Algorithm - combining the advantages of NLP Technology and Content-based Filtering Algorithms. The Website also uses automated Web Scraping techniques for mass aggregation of events from verified sources and related data like venue, genre, price and description. The project undergoes a literature review of various NLP, Deep Learning, Mathematical algorithms and techniques to understand recent advancements in the field of Recommendation frameworks and proposes an Recvent: An Event-Recommending Web Application.
